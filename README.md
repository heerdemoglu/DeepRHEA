# DeepRHEA - Deep Rolling Horizon Evolutionary Algorithm in the Game of Go

This project aims to construct an agent thatuses Deep Neural Networks and RHEA to play a game of deterministic, competitive, zero-sum game with full information. Some possible games that arein this category include Chess, Go, Checkers and Othello.

# Setup and Run:

ToDo.

# Referenced Repositories:

This project uses repositories of different authors. These repositories are listed below for further reference.

## Alpha Zero General, Surag Nair et. al. 

The repository is created by Surag Nair and the repository can be reached through [this](https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general) link.

This repository implements some games where agents inspired from AlphaGo is trained. This repository is used as a baseline to train AlphaGo agent; where DeepRHEA agent 
will be coupled with the same environment for comparison purposes.

ToDo: Other repositories and links. Reference specific authors if they are known.
